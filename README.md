# Angular Materials Modules and Routing

This project is a comprehensive reference to all the ways angular modules can be imported/exported as well as how to best use angular material modules. It also shows all the different ways to route around angular as well as lazy loading.
It also provides my custom technique for navigation as and object tree that is customisable for each project and accessible using the angular multiple application features accessing my very own library. 
This is like my bible when I need to plan a new website and want to nail the architecture.
